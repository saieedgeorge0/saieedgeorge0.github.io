                Founded in 1989, Unaccompanied Women is the oldest a cappella group at UChicago, and one of two all-female groups on campus. We are an extremely close 11-person group, comprising women from all four years who study everything from anthropology to linguistics. Our original arrangements span a wide variety of styles, including artists as different as Janelle Monae and Demi Lovato. In addition to our quarterly concerts, we host an annual fundraiser called Singing Valentines, during which we travel around Hyde Park singing love songs to lucky (and sometimes embarrassed) recipients. We place a big emphasis on group bonding, and view the group as a serious but fun way to make music with some of our best friends.
