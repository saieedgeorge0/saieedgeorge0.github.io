                    <p>Google is arguably the most powerful tool currently available to the masses. As someone who has spent the past five years teaching himself various programming languages, I am perfectly aware of just how useful Google can be - if one wants to solve his own problems and is willing to use it. </p> 

                    <p> When most people have a question, whether it relates to cooking or interior design, they tend to consult Google. 'How do I update my kindle,' 'How do I block a number,' and 'How do I get Netflix on my TV' are just a few of the suggestions that present themselves when I enter the phrase 'How do I' into the popular search engine. </p>

                    <p> If such a powerful utility is so widely available, why have I spent literally hundreds of hours helping people print papers, reset their wireless routers, and unfreezing their phones? Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining - I don't mind helping people, and I actually enjoy it. But why does no one think to use Google when they encounter a technological problem? Why do some people insist that "technology doesn't like me" and walk away, leaving their problems for someone else to solve? </p>

                    <p> Do people not know how to use Google? Or do they not want to, content with relegating the task of making minor fixes to their devices to those other people that are supposedly more 'technologically savvy?' I'm inclined to think that it's the latter. Am I just 'naturally better' with technology than most other people? No - I broke three computers, two printers, and a shredder while in middle school, installing various pieces of software onto the computer and overworking both the printers and shredder. But what set me apart from the rest of my peers was that I spent hours and hours trying to fix what I had broken - and eventually succeeded in doing so. </p>

                    <p> At the high school I attended, when something broke, people immediately walked away and went to look for one of the members of the technology team, my friend (another 'technologically savvy' student), or me. Regardless of who responded, we simply fixed the problem and moved on. No effort was put into actually educating the student on how to solve the problem, so she could solve it on her own the next time it occurred. I'm not blaming the faculty here - I did the same, and the faculty had no further responsibilities past fixing the problem. In addition, there existed no classes to teach students the basics of using computers or any other available electronic devices. The existence of such a class might seem absurd, but in a world where the ability to use technology efficiently is crucial to productivity, such a simple class might be necessary to show people that anyone can become 'technologically savvy.' </p>

                    <p> Why not teach students how to use their computers, printers, and phones? Most of them spend the majority of their time using them for work or play, and so the ability to actually operate what they use would be an incredibly helpful skill. While offering a class on how to use computers might be the most useful, if it is not the most practical course of action, those that deal with information technology at schools might teach how to fix instead of just fixing. Instead of just replacing the paper in a printer when you see the flashing yellow light, teach the student how to recognize that error and what to do in response in the future. Instead of just connecting that printer to the student's computer, teach them how to actually do it. And honestly, this applies to anyone - if you know how to use technology, don't just fix other people's problems, show them how to do it for themselves. </p>

                    <p> Is this a niche issue? Maybe. But more and more schools are implementing a one-to-one program (each student must bring a laptop with them) and it makes no sense to force students to use a tool they can't fully use. In a world where technology is becoming increasingly prevalent, it's important that people enter the workforce with the capability to use technology and fix any minor problems that may arise.  I'll leave you with a minor anecdote which illustrates the importance of what I am discussing - take the modern toilet, for instance. It has become so essential to our daily lives that just about everyone uses it everyday, several times a day. Imagine if you had a friend who couldn't use the toilet. Each time he used it, he would need someone to help him operate it. This would grow extremely cumbersome, for both parties involved, and it would be to his advantage to finally learn how to use the toilet. A ridiculous analogy? You might think so, but as we use technology to do more and more, it will become increasingly more important to be able to actually know what what we're using and how to fix it. So, the next time you go to ask someone for help with a wireless router that isn't working, maybe consider going to Google first.</p>
